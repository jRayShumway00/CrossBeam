# CrossBeam
CrossBeam is being designed to be an OpenSource 3D rendering engine with the main goal of becoming a suitable 3D renderer for video game development. At the moment I am still learning a bit about OpenGL, but once I finish I will get the ball rolling and we can start seeing some progress. CrossBeam will eventually become it's own standalone game engine, and at first will be based entirely in OpenGL. In the future I plan on making it Direct3D compatible so that it runs more efficiently on Windows-based computers.
